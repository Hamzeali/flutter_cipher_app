# Cipher App

It's a simple cipher app made with dart and flutter framework.
I have implemented 4 ciphers to encrypt and decrypt texts. The 4 ciphers are:
- Caesar Cipher
- Atbash Cipher
- Monoalphabetic
- ROT-13

With each cipher you can see a small simulation which describes how the cipher works.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
